Project Title: "My First Microgame" 

Description: my game is going to have a new character and a new room and the gravity is going to be less so its a little bit harder to play. 

Setup Instructions: How to open and run your game. 

Reflection: 50-100 words on what you learned, what worked well, and any challenges. 
  Making this game was something I have never done before. It is completely new and it was really hard but the step by step instruction really helped.
