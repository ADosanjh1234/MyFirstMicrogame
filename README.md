Project Title: "My First Microgame" 

Description: my game is going to have a new character and a new room and the gravity is going to be less so its a little bit harder to play. 

Setup Instructions: How to open and run your game.

Reflection: 50-100 words on what you learned, what worked well, and any challenges. 

  Making this game was something I have never done before. It is completely new and it was really hard but the step by step instruction really helped. I had a lot of trouble with finding the files they were talking about in the instructions. But I fugured them out by asking my friends or the teacher about them. I did make a few changes in the game but then it was almost impossible to win because the extra character I added would just be at the front and would kill the character as soon as the game started, so I had to fix them and now the game is harder than it was before the tutorial but it is easier to win because the extra character doesn't just kill you as soon as the game starts.  

The pictures and the link to the game is attached to the word doc because I can't attach it here it is not allowing me to.
